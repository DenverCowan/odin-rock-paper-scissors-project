# Rock Paper Scissors project

## Skills I learned or got better with during this project:

-Attaching JS to html files in head and body. if using in head use keyword defer

-Using functions to really break the problem down into the smallest component parts so that at the end all thats left to do is make a single function call that handles the rest.

## Future Plans

1. Make a GUI for the application.
2. Make a game tracker that keeps up with wins and losses until the browser window is closed.
