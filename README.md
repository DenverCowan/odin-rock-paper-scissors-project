# Rock Paper Scissors project

[LIVE PREVIEW](https://denvercowan.github.io/rps/)

## Skills I learned or got better with during this project:

-Attaching JS to html files in head and body. if using in head use keyword defer

-Using functions to really break the problem down into the smallest component parts so that at the end all thats left to do is make a single function call that handles the rest.

-changing DOM objects

## Future Plans

1. Make a sign up option with a database and user authentication to keep track of users and game records.
2. add some more visual features like displaying what both parties selected each round.
